    <h1>All About Penguins</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="container">
        <p>Penguins are flightless birds that live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. There are 18 species of penguins, ranging in size from the little blue penguin, which is about the size of a turkey, to the emperor penguin, which can grow to be over 4 feet tall and weigh over 100 pounds.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <p>Penguins are excellent swimmers and can stay underwater for up to 20 minutes at a time. They use their wings as flippers to propel themselves through the water, and they have a layer of thick feathers that helps to keep them warm.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <p>Penguins are facing a number of threats, including climate change, habitat loss, and pollution. Climate change is causing the sea ice to melt, which is making it difficult for penguins to find food and raise their young. Habitat loss is also a problem, as penguins are losing their breeding grounds to development and other human activities. Pollution is also a threat, as penguins can be poisoned by oil spills and other pollutants.</p>
